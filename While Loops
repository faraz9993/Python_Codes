# While Loops Exercise
# For this exercise, you will print 10 descending integers starting from 10 and ending at 1 with each integer being 1 less than the last and each integer printed on a new line.
# Create a variable and assign it the integer 10.
# Then, print
# 10
# 9
# 8
# 7
# 6
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# in the output by using a while loop to print numbers while the variable does not equal 0. Use the -= operator to reassign descending values to the variable.

counter = 10
while counter >= 1:
  print(counter)
  counter -= 1
