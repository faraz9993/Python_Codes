# "and" operators
# - Both the conditions must be True to get the True as an output.
# True and True					True
# True and False				False

# "or"  operators
# Any one condition is True the output will be True

# "not" operator
# If the condition is False not will make is True. Same way,

# not False					True

# Ex.
print(not 6480 < 0)
